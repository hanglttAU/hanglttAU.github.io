## About Me
- 15+ years of working experience across Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, and the US, bringing a unique cross-cultural perspective and adaptability to global environments.
- Dual education in Engineering and IT, providing problem-solving skills as well as technical skills needed to implement solutions.
- Experience in a wide range of BI tools, offering the ability to not only extract and analyze complex data but also present it effectively.

## Experience
**Business Owner, US (2024-present)**  
- Business Domain Knowledge: Managing all aspects of an online Etsy store, including inventory management, pricing strategy, customer service, and marketing for 30+ products, gaining domain knowledge in small business operations and reaching 30 cities across the US in 3 months. <br>
- Data Analysis: Analyzed metrics such as favorites, orders per visit, and views per visit to develop strategies for improving shop visibility, promotions, and inventory planning.

**Analyst, Australia (2016-2021)**  
•	Business Intelligence: Aggregated data using R and created self-serve dashboards in Power BI and Tableau to present 15 years of train and tram demain across various dimentions (yearly, quarterly, monthly, hourly, day type, location), reducing repsonse time for data requests from 2 days to less than 1 hour, ensuring timely, consistent, and accurate reporting. 

•	Business Process Automation: Transformed legacy data structures from MS Access and Excel into organized databases and automated processes using SQL Server and R scripts, achieving a 500% performance increase by reducing a 3-hour manual task to a 30-minute automatic task weekly.

•	Data Analysis: Developed data analysis algorithms in R to estimate tram travel demand, identify passengers affected by train disruptions, and aggregate train line loadings. Visualized results and effectively communicated findings with stakeholders, enhancing team capacity by more than 100%. 

•	Data Science: Utilized historical public transport demand in a short-term forecasting model in R to project patronage for the next 1-2 year. 

•	BI Deliverable: Worked with transport models to extract long-term travel demand forecasts, transforming modelling outputs from matrix format to table format using CUBE language. Organized 10+ different data formats for 20+ scenarios into MySQL and PostGreSQL (for shapefiles) using R, and visualized and managed reports in Tableau Server. This improved report writing time from weeks to hours, particularly for map generation, while also providing opportunities for collaboration with stakeholders. 

**Transport Planner, Singapore (2009-2015)**  
•	Data Communication: Acted as the liaison between Transport Planning and IT departments to develop a transport planning data warehouse, including testing data integrity, providing SQL scripts for complex transport problems, and creating standardized dashboards in Tableau and Business Objects. 

•	Data Visualization: Utilized SQL to extract relevant information from the Teradata warehouse, such as interpolating bus positions every minute for 4,500 buses to visualize bus crowding during  morning peak in Tableau, extracting bus demand for 300 bus routes to create semi-circle charts using Excel VBA, and calculating bus loading to map it onto shapefiles in ArcGIS. 

•	Data Analysis: Conducted analysis of what-if scenarios in transport modelling and planning, such as evaluating the impact of increasing the bus fleet on crowding, or adjusting school times to reduce morning traffic. Used SQL and Tableau to to deliver insights in response to business requests within a week. 

•	BI Deliverable: Conducted fare analysis for up to 10 fare change scenarios simultaneously, providing insights for government, operators, and passengers using SQL and Tableau. This improved processing time from 1 week to just 1 day. 

**Lecturer, Vietnam (2001-2006)**  
•	Data Teaching: Instructed Database and Graph Theory courses for 2 years and provided lab instruction for various IT courses for 5 years. 

•	Data Engineering and Software Development: Managed a database of academic results for 800 students in SQL Server, imported existing data from various systems (Fortran, MS Access), and developed a web-based application using ASP/HTML to effectively display student report as well as a Visual Basic application for accurate data entry. 

•	Data Learning: Conducted research toward an MS. in Computer Science, completing 10 courseworks to gain deepen knowledge of Database Management Systems (DBMS). 

## Skills
•	Analytics: SQL, R, Python, Excel VBA

•	Database: Teradata, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS Access

•	Business Intelligence: Tableau, Power BI, ArcGIS, QGIS, Business Objects

•	Web Application: ASP, HTML, VBScript, Flask

•	Transport Modelling: CUBE, EMME
